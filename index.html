  <p>Kei trucks are a class of japanese truck which have a requirement of being small and fuel efficient and light
    weight they are verry popular in japan because they pay less taxes on these vehicles. many trucks are 4WD making
    them a good choice for farms and off roading. they come in different configurations like flatbeads dump trucks vans
    and refrigreated trucks. some popular models are Suzuki Carry, Daihatsu Hijet, Honda Acty, Subaru Sambar and
    Mitsubishi Minicab my favorite is the suzuki carry with the round hadlights</p>
